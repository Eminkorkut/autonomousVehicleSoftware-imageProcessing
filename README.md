# autonomousVehicleSoftware-imageProcessing

## What is the purpose of the project?
> This project is designed for autonomous driving software, which has become increasingly common in recent years. Images from the camera in front of the vehicle are processed in sequence and a confidence value is used to decide what the vehicle should do based on possible situations. The image processing part is based on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. The project aims to be further developed through dataset expansion and algorithm development.
